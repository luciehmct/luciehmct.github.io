      "title": "LMMs-Eval â€” Evaluation Suite of Large Multimodal Models",
      "description": "Developed an open-source evaluation framework for large multimodal models (LMMs) supporting text, image, video, and audio tasks. I extended this suite to wildlife datasets (MammAlps, AnimalKingdom) to benchmark models like InternVL3-8B on species and behavior recognition, creating reproducible pipelines and standardized metrics.",
